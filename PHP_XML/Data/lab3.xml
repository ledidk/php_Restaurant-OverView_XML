    <summary>The Gong's food is always consistent. A good variety of dim sum, sushi, Chinese and even Vietnamese dishes. The service is quick and the food is plentiful. We sat&#xD;
            down last night and within seconds of turning in our first order, the plates were on&#xD;
            the table! The teriyaki dishes had the right amount of sauce and weren't&#xD;
            sickeningly sweet. The chicken, fish, and beef were perfectly cooked. The makirolls&#xD;
            were neatly rolled, cut properly and seasoned well. Loved the General Tao chicken, the&#xD;
            steamed BBQ pork buns, the eel sushi and the lovely eggplant. We&#xD;
            will be going back again! I would highly recommend it.</summary>

    <summary>My favorite restaurant in Ottawa. The family who owns it are very warm and
            lovely people. They are incredible at recognizing you when you come back. The
            burritos are super good. You can customize however you want (guac is included!).
            I especially love that there is cactus in the veggie mix; it is a small, special thing
            that sets this place apart from other Mexican spots downtown.</summary>
